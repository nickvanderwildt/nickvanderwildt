### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Nick, a VP of Technology at Adyen by day, and a programming enthusiast by night. My self-taught journey in programming went from Ruby (on Rails), to Python, JS/TS, Elixir, and finally to Golang and C#. In the end, I tend to pick Ruby or Golang depending on the project, as they help me get stuff done the fastest.
